As a capstone project for Data Science with Python course on Codecademy, I analyzed Twitter data. I predicted location of a tweet and whether it will go viral or not.

1. Using Naive Bayes Classifier, predicted the location of the tweet (New York, Paris or London)
2. Using K Nearest Neighbors, guessed wheter a tweet will go viral or not
